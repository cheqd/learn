# ðŸ“ˆ Tokenomics

Tokenomics are typically documented and distributed via a dedicated whitepaper. However, since a large proportion of the tokenomics for cheqd directly relate to governance, our tokenomics will be a constant iteration, we incorporated them into the cheqd networkâ€™s documentation here, which will also be continuously updated. We can then continue using blogs to explain the initial and updated tokenomics in an easier to digest format.
