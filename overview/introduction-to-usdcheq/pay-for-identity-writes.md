# Pay for identity transactions

At a basic level, the CHEQ token is used to pay identity writes on the cheqd network. This functionality is made available through custom modules built by cheqd for [DIDs](../introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-a-decentralised-identifier-did/) and [on-ledger Resources](../introduction-to-decentralised-identity/what-is-an-on-ledger-resource.md).

## Identity writes to the ledger

As cheqd is integrated into more Software Development Kits, it will become easier for cheqd's partners to write identity transactions to the network.

### Decentralised Identifier writes

CHEQ tokens are used to write DIDs, update DIDs and deactivate DIDs on the cheqd network. The initial pricing for the cheqd network is as follows:

| Description    | CHEQ | cheqd   | Sovrin |
| -------------- | ---- | ------- | ------ |
| Create DID     | 66   | \~$2.00 | $10.00 |
| Update DID     | 33   | \~$1.00 | $10.00 |
| Deactivate DID | 33   | \~$1.00 | $10.00 |

### On-ledger resource writes

CHEQ tokens are used to write on-ledger resources, such as Schemas, Credential Definitions and other assets. The initial pricing for the cheqd network is as follows:

| Description                           | CHEQ | cheqd   | Sovrin |
| ------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- | ------ |
| Create Schema                         | 3.3  | \~$0.10 | $50.00 |
| Create Credential Definition          | 3.3  | \~$0.10 | $25.00 |
| Create Revocation Registry Definition | 3.3  | \~$0.10 | $20.00 |
| Create Revocation Registry Entry      | 3.3  | \~$0.10 | $0.10  |
