# What is Staking & Delegation?

## What does staking mean? <a href="#2752" id="2752"></a>

**A stake** is the amount of tokens a **Node Operator** puts aside and dedicates to a network’s active pool to contribute to governance and earn rewards. **Staking** is the verb used to describe this contribution. As cheqd is a Proof of Stake (PoS) Network, rewards can be earned in direct correlation with the amount of stake a Node Operator contributes.

## What is delegation? <a href="#3caf" id="3caf"></a>

Token holders, ‘**users’,** can **delegate** their tokens to Node Operators in order to earn rewards and participate in governance. Once a user has delegated tokens to a Node Operator and has tokens added to the active pool, they are known as **Participants.**

Users can delegate to multiple Node Operators at the same time to essentially diversify their bonded token portfolio.

Bonded tokens are those present in the active pool.

**Bonded** tokens = **staked** tokens by Node Operator + **delegated** tokens by a user.
