# What are the different types of Verifiable Credentials?

## Overview

There are three core types of Verifiable Credentials

* [JSON (JWT)](json-jwt.md)
* [JSON-LD](json-ld.md)
* [AnonCreds](anoncreds.md)

This concept is best explained by the Kaliya Young and the Covid Credential Initiative's paper on the different flavours of Verifiable Credentials.
