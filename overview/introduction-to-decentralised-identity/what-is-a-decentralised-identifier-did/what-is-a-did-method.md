# What is a DID method?

A DID method is defined by a DID method specification, which specifies the precise operations by which [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) and [DID documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated.

cheqd has its own DID method, which [can be found here](https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method).
