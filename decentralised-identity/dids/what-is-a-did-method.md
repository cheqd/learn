# What is a DID method?

A DID method is defined by a DID method specification, which specifies the precise operations by which [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) and [DID documents](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated.

There are currently **over 100 DID methods**, but only a few which should have working DID Resolvers and DID Registrars.&#x20;
