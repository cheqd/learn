# JSON (JWT)

**JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

JWTs are widely used in legacy identity infrastructure, underlying the frameworks used by [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/). As such, there is a plethora of software libraries and toolkits for developers to build upon using JWT, making their adoption far more seamless than other Verifiable Credential formats.
