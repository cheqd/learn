| **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Layer** | The technical stack 'Layer' for peer-to-peer Connections and Interactions over the Agent-to-Agent Protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Anonym**                              | A DID used exactly once, so it cannot be contextualized or correlated beyond that single usage. See also Pseudonym and Verinym.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Anywise**                             | A non-reciprocal relationship rooted in the Identity of one party, where the other party is the public (a faceless ‚Äúother‚Äù that can be instantiated without bound). For an Organization to issue publicly Verifiable Credentials, its Issuer DID must be on a public ledger such as cheqd. It is thus an Anywise DID‚Äîa DID to which any other Entity may refer without coordination. The term ‚Äúpublic DID‚Äù is sometimes used as a casual synonym for ‚ÄúAnywise DID‚Äù. However, ‚Äúpublic DID‚Äù is deprecated because it is ambiguous, i.e., it may refer to a DID that is world-visible but usable only in pairwise mode, or to a DID that is not published in a central location but nonetheless used in many contexts, or to a DID that is both publicly visible and used in Anywise mode. Compare N-wise and Pairwise.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **ATOM**                                | The exchange token that runs and transacts natively on the Cosmos ledger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Coin**                                | A coin operates on its own independent blockchain and acts like a native currency within a specific financial system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Connection**                          | A cryptographically verifiable communications channel established using an Agent-to-Agent Protocol between two DIDs representing two Entities and their associated Agents. Connections may be Edge-to-Edge Connections or Cloud-to-Cloud Connections. Connections may be used to exchange Verifiable Credentials or for any other communications purpose. Connections may be encrypted and decrypted using the Public Keys and Private Keys for each DID. A Connection may be temporary or it may last as long as the two Entities desire to keep it. Two Entities may have multiple Connections between them, however each Connection must be between a unique pair of DIDs. A relationship between more than two Entities may be modeled either as Pairwise connections between all of the Entities (Peering) or each Entity can form a Connection with an Entity representing a Group.                                                                                 |
| **Connection Invitation**               | An Agent-to-Agent Protocol message type sent from one Entity to a second Entity to invite the second Entity to send a Connection Request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Credential**                          | <p>A digital assertion containing a set of Claims made by an Entity about itself or another Entity. Credentials are a subset of Identity Data. A Credential is based on a Credential Definition.</p><ul><li>The Entity described by the Claims is called the Subject of the Credential.</li><li>The Entity creating the Credential is called the Issuer.</li><li>The Entity holding the issued Credential is called the Holder.</li><li>The Entity to whom a Credential is presented is generally called the Relying Party, and specifically called the Verifier if the Credential is a Verifiable Credential.</li></ul><p>Once issued, a Credential is typically stored by an Agent. (In cheqd's infrastructure, Credentials are never stored on the Ledger.) Credentials are very broad in their potential use: Examples of Credentials include college transcripts, driver licenses, health insurance cards, and building permits. See also Verifiable Credential.</p> |
| **Credential Definition (CredDef)**     | A machine-readable definition of the semantic structure of a Credential based on one or more Schemas.
