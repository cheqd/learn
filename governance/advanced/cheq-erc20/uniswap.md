# How to add CHEQ tokens to UniSwap Liquidity Pools

Now that you have **CHEQ-ERC20** tokens you can engage with DeFi activities within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Within UniSwap you can either Swap tokens, or add them to a Liquidity Pool.

To find out more about Liquidity Pools, head to [What is a Liquidity Pool?](../liquidity-pool/)

## **Adding tokens to a Liquidity Pool**

### Step 1: Find Pool

As a pool has been created on UniSwap these instructions offer insight into how to use UniSwap, however other options exists and CHEQ will likely appear on them in the near future.

Head to the [CHEQ:USDT](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa305f3aad48e285c002a2dbadbbba58fea10ad45) pool.

If you'd like to reduce the transaction fee you can select a lower one using the updated MetaMask. To turn this on, go to your settings in MetaMask and select '**Experimental**' and toggle the '**Enable Enhance Gas Fee UI**' to **ON**
