# Making Network Changes

## How do I make changes on the Network?

Every User is encouraged to contribute to the cheqd Network. To make this easy, it is important to explain HOW a User can contribute, and what the best practices are for making changes.

For this reason, it is important to distinguish when a change can be made entirely off-ledger, and when a change is needed to be voted on, and made on-ledger. To do this we must differentiate between **minor changes** which are able to take place **entirely off-ledger** and **major network changes** which need to be **formalised on-ledger.**

### **Minor Network changes**

These are changes that are insignificant, and do not affect the way the Network runs overall. Minor Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Textual edits to the Governance Framework or written general documentation;
* Sensible additions to general documentation to improve clarity;
* Minor code changes;
* Finding, reporting and suggesting fixes to bugs;
* Translating the cheqd documentation into various languages.

### Major Network changes

These are changes that have a materially significant effect on the Network. Such changes SHOULD be made via a Proposal, following the steps in the decision tree diagram below.

Major Network changes include, but are not limited to:

* Materially significant Architecture Decisions (**ADs**), such as:
  * An additional feature to cheqd;
  * Removal of a feature of cheqd;
* Parameter changes for the Network;
* Community pool decisions;
* Materially significant changes to a cheqd Principle;
* Significant connections to other infrastructure.

## cheqd's Principles

Whenever a **major network change** takes place on the Network, reference MUST be made to [cheqd's Foundational Principles](broken-reference). The Principles should act as a checks and balance against **major network changes.**

This means, that **major network changes** should never oppose a Principle, unless it is [acting to update or change a Principle](broken-reference).
