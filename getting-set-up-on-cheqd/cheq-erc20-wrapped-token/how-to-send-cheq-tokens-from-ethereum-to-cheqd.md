# How to send CHEQ tokens from Ethereum to cheqd

The following instructions will be lighter weight as much of the general process has been explained  in the earlier steps:

**Step 1: Set your Source chain and Destination chain**

Go to [SpaceStation](https://spacestation.zone/) and select the respective chains. Your Source chain should be Ethereum, and your Destination chain Gravity Bridge.

**Step 2: Initiate Transfer**

Initiate Transfer by selecting the token you wish to transfer and the amount, hit transfer and confirm.

**Step 3: Approve the transfer**&#x20;

A MetaMask pop-up will appear. Check the transaction fees and approve the transfers (again, the high transfer fees are on the Ethereum side, not Cosmos.&#x20;

Fortunately these fees will reduce based on the volumes of transfers on the Gravity Bridge thanks to the Batching mechanism designed as part of the bridge).

**Step 4: Transfer tokens to your final destination chain**&#x20;

Finally, transfer the tokens from the Gravity Bridge chain to your final destination chain (the cheqd network).&#x20;



If at any point you want to check the transfer, you can enter your Gravity address into [MintScan using G-Bridge.](https://www.mintscan.io/gravity-bridge)

And that’s it, your tokens are now available in your Keplr wallet and can be used once again for all things Cosmos!
