## **Adding tokens to a Liquidity Pool**

### Step 1: Find Pool

As a pool has been created on UniSwap these instructions offer insight into how to use UniSwap, however other options exists and CHEQ will likely appear on them in the near future.

Head to the [CHEQ:USDT](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa305f3aad48e285c002a2dbadbbba58fea10ad45) pool.

If you'd like to reduce the transaction fee you can select a lower one using the updated MetaMask. To turn this on, go to your settings in MetaMask and select '**Experimental**' and toggle the '**Enable Enhance Gas Fee UI**' to **ON**
