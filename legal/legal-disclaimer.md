The Information Material relates primarily to the intended development and use of the cheqd Network by various Participants, Node Operators and Users. Some of the Information Material relates to the acquisition of cryptographic tokens to be used in the cheqd Network (“CHEQ”).

There will not be, and has not been, any Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or Initial Token Offering involving CHEQ.

No regulatory authority in Singapore, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, has reviewed or approved the CHEQ tokens or any of the Information Material. The acquisition of tokens is subject to a potential acquirer's compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdiction they reside in.

The Information Material does not constitute either an offer or solicitation of securities or any other regulated product and is neither a promotion, invitation nor solicitation for investment purposes. The CHEQ tokens do not represent equity, shares, units, royalties or rights to capital, profit, returns or income in the cheqd Network or any other company or intellectual property associated with the cheqd ecosystem, or any other public or private enterprise, corporation, foundation or other entity in any jurisdiction. The CHEQ Tokens are not intended to represent a security or similar legal interest.

No information or opinion presented herein is intended as specific recommendations or to form the basis for any purchase or investment decision. Accordingly, the Information Material does not constitute investment advice or counsel or a solicitation for investment in any token or instrument. Prospective acquirers should consult with their professional advisors and advisors as needed prior to coming to their own conclusion on whether to acquire the CHEQ Tokens in their own jurisdiction.

The acquisition of CHEQ Tokens carries with it significant risks and is inherently speculative in nature. Prospective acquirers should carefully assess and take into account such risks prior to acquiring CHEQ Tokens. cheqd's initial core team and all of their collective past, present or future officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, advisors or consultants, or any other person (collectively, “cheqd”), expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (a) reliance on any information contained in the Information Material; (b) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information; and (c) any action resulting therefrom. cheqd does not guarantee the accuracy of the statements made or conclusions reached in the Information Material and does not make, and expressly disclaims, all representations and warranties (whether express or implied by statute or otherwise). The Information Material does not constitute advice, nor any recommendations, by cheqd or any of its affiliates and all of their collective past, present or future officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, advisors or consultants, or any other person, to any recipient of the Information Material.

No regulatory authority has examined or approved any information set forth in the Information Material. No such action has been or will be taken under the laws, regulatory requirements or rules of any jurisdiction. The publication, distribution or dissemination of the Information Material does not imply that applicable laws, regulatory requirements or rules have been complied with.

The distribution or dissemination of the Information Material or any part thereof may be prohibited or restricted by the laws, regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction. Persons to whom a copy of the Information Material has been distributed or disseminated or provided access to, or who otherwise have the Information Material in their possession, shall not circulate to any other persons, reproduce or otherwise distribute the Information Material or any information contained herein for any purpose whatsoever nor permit or cause the same to occur.

### **Caution regarding forward-looking statements**

Certain statements in the Information Material may constitute “forward-looking information” under various securities laws. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be identified by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or the negative of such terms, or other similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are provided to allow acquirers of the CHEQ Tokens the opportunity to understand cheqd's initial beliefs and opinions in respect of the potential future, including forward-looking statements related to the proposed operating model for cheqd, which should not be construed as a forecast, projection or prediction of future results of cheqd operations.

This is also because cheqd will be taken forward through a decentralised governance process, whereby the consensus of the Network will make decisions on the direction of the Network.

The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analysis based on current estimates, assumptions, conditions and expected future developments and other factors cheqd initially believes are appropriate.

The cheqd Network will be taken forward and developed through a decentralised governance process, whereby the consensus of the Network will make decisions on the direction of the Network.

As such, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual future success of cheqd, the CHEQ token or its performance to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expected, expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

These factors include, but are not limited to, risks associated with:

* cheqd's ability to launch and develop the cheqd Network or ecosystem;
* cheqd's businesses and operations;
* CHEQ Token’s volatility and price points;
* Unfavourable legal or regulatory actions;
* Tax treatment of CHEQ Tokens;
* A restriction of transfer of CHEQ Tokens;
* A user’s inability to access wallets containing CHEQ;
* The compromise of a user’s credentials;
* Insufficient interest in the cheqd Network, ecosystem or blockchain technologies;
* cheqd's ability to continuously adapt its business model to meet market needs;
* Competitive technologies;
* Security weaknesses;
* cheqd's ability to effectively protect its intellectual property;
* Meeting regulatory obligations in the countries in which cheqd intends to operate; and
* Meeting users’ expectations regarding the functionality of the cheqd Network and ecosystem.

### **Restrictions on distribution**

The distribution or dissemination of the Information Material or CHEQ Tokens may be prohibited or restricted by the laws, regulatory requirements and rules of any jurisdiction. In the case where any restriction applies, you must inform yourself about, and observe, any restrictions that are applicable to your possession of the Information Material or CHEQ Tokens or any part thereof at your own expense and without liability to cheqd. The Information Material may not be redistributed, reproduced, published or passed on to any other person, in part or in whole, for any purpose, without the express prior written consent of cheqd.
